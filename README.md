# DSU-Curriculum-Fall-2020
This repository contains all the material that was presented to new members of the [Data Science Union](http://datascienceunion.com/) at UCLA in the Fall quarter of the 2020-21 school year. Here's a rough outline of the entire Fall 2020 curriculum:

* Week 3: Introduction
    * What is data science? The data science process
    * Getting started with Python (and relevant packages)
* Week 4: Data retrieval and preparation
    * Retrieval: downloading, web scraping, and APIs
    * Preparation: cleansing, integration, transformation
* Week 5: Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    * Data exploration: aggregation, split-apply-combine
    * Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
* Week 6: Modeling and machine learning, part 1
    * What is machine learning? Types of ML models
    * Unsupervised learning
        * Examples: K-Means, PCA
    * Supervised learning
        * Fundamental concepts: train-test split, overfitting/underfitting, bias-variance tradeoff
* Week 7: Modeling and machine learning, part 2
    * Supervised learning
        * Classification algorithms
            * Examples: KNN, naive Bayes, decision trees, SVM, logistic regression
        * Regression algorithms
            * Examples: (KNN, decision trees), linear models, neural networks
* *[Week 8: Thanksgiving]*
* Week 9: Neural networks
    * Quick recap
